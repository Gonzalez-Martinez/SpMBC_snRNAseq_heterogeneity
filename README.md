# SpMBC_snRNAseq_heterogeneity

This repository contains the analysis code for the manuscript:

“Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in spindle cell metaplastic breast carcinoma”

## Overview

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on:
- 4 spindle cell metaplastic breast carcinomas (SpMBC)
- 6 invasive breast carcinomas of no special type (IBC-NST)

A total of 162,096 nuclei were analyzed.

The repository includes scripts for:
- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Clustering and cell type annotation
- Identification of malignant cell states
- CNV inference
- Individual tumor analyses

## Data

This repository contains analysis code only.  
Processed data were generated using Cell Ranger (GRCh38).
